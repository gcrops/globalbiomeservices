        Grace GIS offers detailed analysis and mapping of environmental assets
        and green infrastructure to support sustainable urban planning and
        climate resilience. Our services include tree canopy mapping, land
        use/land cover classification, change detection, and green space
        benchmarking. By using high-resolution spatial data and remote sensing,
        we help councils and organisations evaluate ecological health, track
        vegetation trends, and plan for greener, more livable communities.
