      time with a modern data-centric approach using modern data driven
      technologies and linking the data lineage to geospatial analytics Our
      solutions Geospatial Analytics [Box/Image] Today’s technologies—mobile
      devices, location sensors, social media, and more—allow organizations to
      collect time and place (“geo-referenced”) data about practically any
      event. But what are they doing with all that information? Geospatial
      analysis uses this data to build maps, graphs, statistics, and cartograms,
      making complex relationships understandable. Representations like these
      can reveal historical shifts, as well as those underway today. They can
      even point to those that are likely to occur in the future Sales and
