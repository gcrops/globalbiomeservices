        Grace GIS provides solar access and renewable energy assessments to
        support sustainable planning and energy efficiency. Using 3D modelling
        and spatial analysis, we evaluate rooftop suitability, shading risks,
        and solar exposure for residential and urban areas. Our data-driven
        insights help councils, developers, and property owners optimise solar
        panel placement and support broader climate and sustainability go
